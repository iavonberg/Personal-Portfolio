1) As an employer, I want to browse recent projects a prospect has created, so that I can make an informed hiring decision.
2) As a peer, I want to view code, so that I can gather inspiration for my project.
3) As an recruiter, I want easy access to contact information, so that I can reach out to interesting candidates.
